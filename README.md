# developer-meetups

The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).

Loopback is a Node framework used to make REST APIs that generates models and routes from the command line.

To start after cloning the repository (On a Mac):

1) To launch the Loopback explorer:
`brew services start mongo`

`node .`

Preloaded database in the .json file was replaced with a shorthand `db`

## Application architecture

Front end was compiled using Create React App and bootstrapped using MateralizeCSS
