# developer-meetups

The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).

Loopback is a Node framework used to make REST APIs that generates models and routes from the command line.

Preloaded database in the .json file was replaced with a shorthand `db`
Properly formatted mongoose schema data saved in the explorer will load in the local .json file

After cloning the repository (On a Mac):

1) `brew services start mongo` to start the database

2) `node .` to launch the server

## Application architecture

Back end code (Mongo database and the Loopback framework) exist in the common folder
Front end was compiled using Create React App and bootstrapped using MateralizeCSS
